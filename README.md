# 📡 Webhook Delivery System – Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation of a **reliable, scalable webhook handling system** using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis**. The system ensures asynchronous delivery, automatic retries, and robustness through queue-based architecture.

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ Immediate HTTP 202 response to incoming webhooks
- 📦 Queue-based processing using Redis (List & Pub/Sub)
- 🔁 Exponential retry logic via Redis Sorted Set (ZSET)
- 🧠 Persistent storage of webhook events in MongoDB
- 📊 Monitoring & recovery support
- 🚀 Scalable architecture supporting distributed workers

## 🧠 Design Choices & Architecture

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Webhook receipt is decoupled from processing using Redis. This ensures quick API responses and prevents long-running operations from blocking incoming traffic.

### 2. **Redis for Fast Queuing**
- **Redis List (`webhook:queue`)** acts as the primary queue.
- **Pub/Sub (`webhook:new`)** notifies workers in real-time.
- **Redis ZSET (`webhook:retry`)** manages scheduled retries.

### 3. **Retry Mechanism**
- Failed deliveries are retried with **exponential backoff**.
- Retry timestamps are stored as scores in the ZSET.

### 4. **Persistence with MongoDB**
- Every webhook event is stored in MongoDB to track status (`pending`, `success`, `failed`, `permanent_failure`).

### 5. **Scalability & Fault Tolerance**
- Multiple workers can run concurrently across servers.
- Redis ensures atomic queue operations.
- MongoDB persists the state even across system restarts.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- Node.js (v18+)
- MongoDB
- Redis

---

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/webhook-backend.git
cd webhook-backend
```

---

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/webhooks
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
MAX_RETRIES=5
RETRY_BASE_DELAY=5000 # in milliseconds
```

---

### 4. Start the services

#### Start the main server (API and worker):

```bash
npm run start
```

#### Optional: Run retry worker separately

```bash
node retryWorker.js
```

> You can also use a process manager like PM2 for production deployment and scaling.

---

## 📬 API Endpoints

### `POST /webhook/:source`

Receives a webhook from external systems.

**Example**:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/webhook/github -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message":"build success"}'
```

### `GET /debug/status`

Returns current Redis queue size and retry queue info.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Debugging

- Use `GET /debug/status` to inspect queue lengths.
- Webhook events are logged in MongoDB.
- Enable verbose logs in `webhookWorker.js` to see delivery attempts and retries.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Validate source IPs or use secrets for authenticating incoming webhooks.
- Limit retries to avoid infinite loops or webhook flooding.
- Use HTTPS endpoints for secure delivery.

---

## 🏁 Improvements

- Add dead-letter queue (DLQ) for manual inspection of permanently failed events.
- Enable webhook signature verification.
- Add dashboard with metrics (using Grafana or Prometheus).
- Integrate rate limiting 

---

##  Simulated the Full Backend System – test.js  

The test.js script is a self-contained simulation tool that mimics the entire webhook system workflow. It's useful for local testing, CI/CD pipelines, and demo environments to validate the complete backend logic without needing external webhook providers.  
  
🔁 What It Does  
Creates mock webhook events  

- Inserts events into MongoDB with pending status  

- Pushes events to the Redis queue (webhook:queue)  

- Publishes notifications to webhook:new (Pub/Sub)  

- Simulates worker pickup and delivery attempts  

- Triggers retry logic if delivery fails  

- Logs status updates (success, failed, etc.)  

-How to Run
